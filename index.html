                Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. 
                Her narrative songwriting, which often takes inspiration from her personal life, 
                has received widespread critical praise and media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, 
                Swift relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, in 2004 to pursue a career in country music. 
                She broke into the country music scene with her eponymous debut studio album in 2006, 
                which featured the singles "Teardrops on My Guitar" and "Our Song". Swift rose to mainstream 
                prominence with her second studio album, Fearless (2008), a country pop record with crossover appeal. 
                Aided by the top-ten singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me", Fearless was certified 
                Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). 
                Swift's third studio album, Speak Now (2010), blended country pop with elements of rock, 
                featuring the top-ten singles "Mine" and "Back to December".
